# Union Types

Occasionally, you'll run into a library that expects or gives back a `number` or `string`.
For instance, take the following function:

```ts
/**
 * Takes a string and adds "padding" to the left.
 * If 'padding' is a string, then 'padding' is appended to the left side.
 * If 'padding' is a number, then that number of spaces is added to the left side.
 */
function padLeft(value: string, padding: any) {
    // ...
}

padLeft("Hello world", 4); // returns "    Hello world"
```

The problem with `padLeft` is that its `padding` parameter is typed as `any`.
That means that we can call it with an argument that's neither a `number` nor a `string`, but TypeScript will be okay with it.

```ts
let indentedString = padLeft("Hello world", true); // passes at compile time, fails at runtime.
```

In some more traditional object-oriented languages, we might abstract over the two types by creating a hierarchy of types.

```ts
interface Padder {
    getPaddingString(): string
}

class SpaceRepeatingPadder implements Padder {
    constructor(private numSpaces: number) { }
    getPaddingString() {
        return Array(this.numSpaces).join(" ");
    }
}

class StringPadder implements Padder {
    constructor(private value: string) { }
    getPaddingString() {
        return this.value;
    }
}

function padLeft(value: string, padder: Padder) {
    return padder.getPaddingString() + value;
}

padLeft("Hello world", new SpaceRepeatingPadder(4));
```

While this is much more explicit, it's also a little bit overkill.
One of the nice things about the original version of `padLeft` was that we were able to just pass in primitives.
That meant that usage was simple and not overly verbose.
This new approach also wouldn't help if we were just declaring a function that already exists elsewhere.

Instead of `any`, we can use a *union type* for the `padding` parameter:

```ts
/**
 * Takes a string and adds "padding" to the left.
 * If 'padding' is a string, then 'padding' is appended to the left side.
 * If 'padding' is a number, then that number of spaces is added to the left side.
 */
function padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {
    // ...
}

let indentedString = padLeft("Hello world", true); // errors during compilation
```

A union type describes a value that can be one of several types.
We use the vertical bar (`|`) to separate each type, so `number | string | boolean` is the type of a value that can be a `number`, a `string`, or a `boolean`.

If we have a value that has a union type, we can only access members that are common to all types in the union.

```ts
interface Bird {
    fly();
    layEggs();
}

interface Fish {
    swim();
    layEggs();
}

function getSmallPet(): Fish | Bird {
    // ...
}

let pet = getSmallPet();
pet.layEggs(); // okay
pet.swim();    // errors
```

Union types can be a bit tricky here, but it just takes a bit of intuition to get used to.
If a value has the type `A | B`, we only know for *certain* that it has members that both `A` *and* `B` have.
In this example, `Bird` has a member named `fly`.
We can't be sure whether a variable typed as `Bird | Fish` has a `fly` method.
If the variable is really a `Fish` at runtime, then calling `pet.fly()` will fail.

# Type Guards and Differentiating Types

Union types are useful for modeling situations when values can overlap in the types they can take on.
What happens when we need to know specifically whether we have a `Fish`?
A common idiom in JavaScript to differentiate between two possible values is to check for the presence of a member.
As we mentioned, you can only access members that are guaranteed to be in all the constituents of a union type.

```ts
let pet = getSmallPet();

// Each of these property accesses will cause an error
if (pet.swim) {
    pet.swim();
}
else if (pet.fly) {
    pet.fly();
}
```

To get the same code working, we'll need to use a type assertion:

```ts
let pet = getSmallPet();

if ((<Fish>pet).swim) {
    (<Fish>pet).swim();
}
else {
    (<Bird>pet).fly();
}
```

## User-Defined Type Guards

Notice that we had to use type assertions several times.
It would be much better if once we performed the check, we could know the type of `pet` within each branch.

It just so happens that TypeScript has something called a *type guard*.
A type guard is some expression that performs a runtime check that guarantees the type in some scope.
To define a type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a *type predicate*:

```ts
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
    return (<Fish>pet).swim !== undefined;
}
```

`pet is Fish` is our type predicate in this example.
A predicate takes the form `parameterName is Type`, where `parameterName` must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.

Any time `isFish` is called with some variable, TypeScript will *narrow* that variable to that specific type if the original type is compatible.

```ts
// Both calls to 'swim' and 'fly' are now okay.

if (isFish(pet)) {
    pet.swim();
}
else {
    pet.fly();
}
```

Notice that TypeScript not only knows that `pet` is a `Fish` in the `if` branch;
it also knows that in the `else` branch, you *don't* have a `Fish`, so you must have a `Bird`.

## `typeof` type guards

We didn't actually reveal the implementation of the version of `padLeft` which used union types.
We could write it with type predicates as follows:

```ts
function isNumber(x: any): x is number {
    return typeof x === "number";
}

function isString(x: any): x is string {
    return typeof x === "string";
}

function padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {
    if (isNumber(padding)) {
        return Array(padding).join(" ") + value;
    }
    if (isString(padding)) {
        return padding + value;
    }
    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${value}'.`);
}
```

However, having to define a function to figure out if a type is a primitive is kind of a pain.
Luckily, you don't need to abstract `typeof x === "number"` into its own function because TypeScript will recognize it as a type guard on its own.
That means we could just write these checks inline.

```ts
function padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {
    if (typeof padding === "number") {
        return Array(padding).join(" ") + value;
    }
    if (typeof padding === "string") {
        return padding + value;
    }
    throw new Error(`Expected string or number, got '${value}'.`);
}
```

These *`typeof` type guards* are recognized in two different forms: `typeof v === "typename"` and `typeof v !== "typename"`, where `"typename"` must be `"number"`, `"string"`, `"boolean"`, or `"symbol"`.
While TypeScript won't prohibit using a string other than the aforementioned ones, or switching the two sides of the comparison, the language won't recognize those forms as type guards.

## `instanceof` type guards

If you've read about `typeof` type guards and are familiar with the `instanceof` operator in JavaScript, you probably have some idea of what this section is about.

*`instanceof` type guards* are a way of narrowing types using their constructor function.
For instance, let's borrow our industrial string-padder example from earlier:

```ts
interface Padder {
    getPaddingString(): string
}

class SpaceRepeatingPadder implements Padder {
    constructor(private numSpaces: number) { }
    getPaddingString() {
        return Array(this.numSpaces).join(" ");
    }
}

class StringPadder implements Padder {
    constructor(private value: string) { }
    getPaddingString() {
        return this.value;
    }
}

function getRandomPadder() {
    return Math.random() < 0.5 ?
        new SpaceRepeatingPadder(4) :
        new StringPadder("  ");
}

// Type is SpaceRepeatingPadder | StringPadder
let padder: Padding = getRandomPadder();

if (padder instanceof SpaceRepeatingPadder) {
    padder; // type narrowed to 'SpaceRepeatingPadder'
}
if (padder instanceof StringPadder) {
    padder; // type narrowed to 'StringPadder'
}
```

The right side of the `instanceof` needs to be a constructor function, and TypeScript will narrow down to:

1. the type of the function's `prototype` property if its type is not `any`
2. the union of types returned by that type's construct signatures

in that order.

# Type Aliases

Type aliases create a new name for a type.
Type aliases are sometimes similar to interfaces, but can name primitives, unions, tuples, and any other types that you'd otherwise have to write by hand.

```ts
type XCoord = number;
type YCoord = number;

type XYCoord = { x: XCoord; y: YCoord };
type XYZCoord = { x: XCoord; y: YCoord; z: number };

type Coordinate = XCoord | XYCoord | XYZCoord;
type CoordList = Coordinate[];

let coord: CoordList = [{ x: 10, y: 10}, { x: 0, y: 42, z: 10 }, { x: 5 }];
```

Aliasing doesn't actually create a new type - it creates a new *name* to refer to that type.
So `10` is a perfectly valid `XCoord` and `YCoord` because they both just refer to `number`.
Aliasing a primitive is not terribly useful, though it can be used as a form of documentation.

Just like interfaces, type aliases can also be generic - we can just add type parameters and use them on the right side of the alias declaration:

```ts
type Container<T> = { value: T };
```

We can also have a type alias refer to itself in a property:

```ts
type Tree<T> = {
    value: T;
    left: Tree<T>;
    right: Tree<T>;
}
```

However, it's not possible for a type alias to appear anywhere else on the right side of the declaration:

```ts
type Yikes = Array<Yikes>; // error
```

## Interfaces vs. Type Aliases

As we mentioned, type aliases can act sort of like interfaces; however, there are some subtle differences.

One important difference is that type aliases cannot be extended or implemented from (nor can they extend/implement other types).
Because [an ideal property of software is being open to extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle), you should always use an interface over a type alias if possible.

On the other hand, if you can't express some shape with an interface and you need to use a union or tuple type, type aliases are usually the way to go.
